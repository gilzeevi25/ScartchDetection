# Wafers scratch detection 
## The topic of this notebook is the detection of scratches on wafers.
It is a proposed solution for an assignment published by National Instruments: [NI Scratch detection assignment](https://github.com/NI-DS/scratch_detection_assignment)
<br><br>
While the resulting F1 score may not be optimal, the notebook contains well-designed tabular features created through image processing techniques.<br>
Additionally, the notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a LightGBM algorithm with an extremely imbalanced dataset, and concludes by implementing an ensemble of LightGBM models to avoid overfitting.<br>
In the end i conclude and suggest more ways to expand and improve my suggested solution
