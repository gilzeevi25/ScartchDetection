# Wafers scratch detection 
### This notebook focuses on detecting the location of scratches on wafers, rather than simply predicting whether a scratch exists or not. The goal is to predict the precise location of the scratch pixels on the wafer.

It is a proposed solution for an assignment published by National Instruments: [NI Scratch detection assignment](https://github.com/NI-DS/scratch_detection_assignment)
<br><br>
While the resulting F1 score may not be optimal, the notebook contains well-designed tabular features created through image processing techniques.<br>
Additionally, the notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a LightGBM algorithm with an extremely imbalanced dataset, and concludes by implementing an ensemble of LightGBM models to avoid overfitting.<br>
In the end i conclude and suggest more ways to expand and improve my suggested solution
